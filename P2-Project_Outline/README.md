## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our objective is to create a fleet management and job management portal, targeted to serve the needs of a business that manages a small to medium fleet of vehicles used for shuttle or taxi service. This would involve the documentation of vehicle status and needed maintenance from three different perspectives: the manager, the driver, and the repairman. Our application is a technological advancement for any company handling a fleet of vehicles, not only to provide and schedule maintenance it will also allow the end user to assign, dispatch, and submit jobs between driver and management.
Within the application, we will provide individual log-ins for Drivers and Managers. This will grant drivers the ability to inform management of what they are doing where they are and when they are ready to accept a new assignment, along with doing daily inspection on their assigned Vehicles including any issues. The logged-in user will have different options available depending on their assigned role. For example, the manager would be able to assign tasks, monitor efficiency, and access an overview of all vehicle statuses. Managers will also be able to create jobs and perform fleet management operations such as adding a new vehicle or creating a service record. The drivers would use the most efficient route from job to job, which is generated through a map. The driver would also be assigned a vehicle to use for the duration of the workday and is responsible for submitting servicing reports through the app, detailing the problem, which then gets sent to the repairman. The repairman would be able to view a spreadsheet that details what repairs need to be made, as well as change the vehicle status after repairs are finished.
We believe that our application will provide our end-user with a more advanced ability to track and manage their fleet remotely. This will also allow managers to build, assign, and modify jobs more quickly and efficiently. This idea stemmed from our previous work experience where all work, maintenance requests, vehicle logs, and dispatch was all done longhand.
